<h1>8 Puzzle iOS App</h1>

<p>Very simple 8 puzzle iOS app developed using MVC pattern and A* AI Algorithm to give hints to the user as fast as possible</p>

<h2>About The Project</h2>
<p> This project created for the AI Course to apply the A* algorithm in real life scenario, I decided to apply the algorithm on the the 8 puzzle
game, so that the algorithm solve the the whole puzzle and give the user the next move as a hint. I also decided to develop an iOS App for it to
learn developing MVC iOS app from scratch, The whole A* Algorithm written in swift.</p>
<h2>Start Using The Beta Version</h2>
<p> Link of the app will be posted very soon.</p>
<h2>Technologies And Algorithms Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Swift language for the model, view and the controller including the A* algorithm.</li>
  <li>Xcode 10 to develop the whole app.</li>
  <li>A* algorithm to give the user the next hint.</li>
  <li>iOS MVC architectural pattern.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages And Limits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the app takes a long time to give the next hint, the reason for that no multithreading or hash tables used to improve the performance.</li>
<li>Multithreading  not used.</li>
<li>Only arrays used in the algorithm and no hash tables used.</li>
<li>The difficulty of the game is medium or easy, the hard level is not available as an option because that will take a very long time for the algorithm to solve.</li>
<li> The app choose the difficulty level randomly so that the user don't have an option to choose the difficulty.</li>
<li> The app is very simple so that when the user won we only show him that by rotating the screen.</li>
<li> There is no points for each user and no implementation to save the user highest record.</li>
</ul>
